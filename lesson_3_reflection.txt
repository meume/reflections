When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Working from different computers, working in a team, as a backup.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It's better to control what changes got pulled and merged with you local repository.
