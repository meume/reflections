When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Working from different computers, working in a team, as a backup.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It's better to control what changes got pulled and merged with you local 
	repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

	Fork is a github copy of someone else's github repository. Fork used not only to 
	copy, but also to acknowledge original author. Clone is a copy of a repository 
	from github or local machine on a local machine. Branch is the version of 
	repository's content stored inside that repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
locally?

	To reduce number of possible conflicts by having most actual version of the 
	files in the local repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and 
what would be harder?

	By manually comparing files. Comparing changes and merging versions would 
	be much harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly 
in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	When a change is big enough to break code. With branches there always 
	will be a working version.
