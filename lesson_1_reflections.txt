How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Bug appeared due to changes, so viewing difference localized the bug search
    area.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It gives opportunity to rollback, track changes, makes it easier to track bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: each commit represents logical change, cons: you have to remember to
    commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Systems like Git are designed to work with code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows history of commits, which can be compared by their id's with
    git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It gives me opportunity to get back to working version and see exactly where
    the bug is.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use it on my projects
